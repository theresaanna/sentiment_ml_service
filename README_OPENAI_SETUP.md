# OpenAI Integration Setup

## Summary of Changes Made

✅ **Removed all backup summary logic** - The system now only uses OpenAI for summaries
✅ **Simplified CommentSummarizer** - No more fallback methods or transformer models
✅ **Updated to modern OpenAI API** - Using the new `OpenAI` client instead of deprecated methods
✅ **Enhanced prompt engineering** - More verbose, conversational summaries that highlight commonalities and differences

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Your OpenAI API Key

You mentioned you added the OpenAI key to your environment. Make sure it's exported in your current shell session:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

To make this permanent, add it to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Test the Integration

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python3 test_openai_summarizer.py
```

You should see:
- ✅ OpenAI API key is available
- ✅ CommentSummarizer imported successfully
- ✅ CommentSummarizer initialized successfully
- ✅ Sample summarization successful!

### 3. Test with Your Application

Start the FastAPI server locally:

```bash
export USE_FAKE_PIPELINE=1
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then test the summarization endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/summarize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "comments": [
      {"text": "This video is amazing! Lady Gaga always delivers.", "likes": 15},
      {"text": "I do not agree with her feminist views but respect her artistry.", "likes": 8},
      {"text": "Great interview, very insightful questions.", "likes": 12}
    ],
    "sentiment": {
      "overall_sentiment": "mixed",
      "sentiment_percentages": {"positive": 60.0, "negative": 30.0, "neutral": 10.0},
      "individual_results": [
        {"predicted_sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.9},
        {"predicted_sentiment": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7},
        {"predicted_sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.8}
      ]
    },
    "method": "openai"
  }'
```

## What Changed

### Before
- Multiple fallback methods (transformer, objective, OpenAI)
- Complex initialization with `use_openai` parameter
- Old OpenAI API syntax (`openai.ChatCompletion.create`)

### After
- **OpenAI only** - No fallback methods
- Simple initialization: `CommentSummarizer()`
- Modern OpenAI client: `self.client.chat.completions.create`
- **Enhanced prompts** for more verbose, conversational summaries
- **Focus on commonalities and differences** between comment themes

## Expected Output

The new summaries will be:
- **More conversational** ("The audience is absolutely loving this!" vs dry statistics)
- **More verbose** (3-4 substantial paragraphs vs brief bullet points)  
- **More insightful** (highlights emotional undercurrents and social dynamics)
- **Better balanced** (specifically calls out commonalities and differences in viewer opinions)
- **Uses emojis strategically** for emphasis and engagement

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key is NOT available"
- Verify the environment variable: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Make sure you're in the same terminal session where you set it
- Try restarting your terminal and setting it again

### "Failed to import CommentSummarizer"
- Make sure you're in the project directory
- Verify the openai package is installed: `pip3 list | grep openai`

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI has rate limits for API calls
- The system includes caching to reduce API calls
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan if you hit limits frequently

## Cost Considerations

- Each summary request costs approximately $0.001-0.003 (depending on comment length)
- Caching is enabled for 6 hours to reduce costs
- Consider implementing additional rate limiting for production use
